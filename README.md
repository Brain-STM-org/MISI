# Machine Intelligence Senior Internship (MISI)

A 4-week internship program for graduating high school seniors to explore the future of software development through AI-assisted tools and proven engineering principles.

## Overview

Many high schools require either a Senior Project or an Internship experience to graduate, typically occurring during the last few weeks of school in May and early June. Software engineering is in an LLM-assisted renaissance, where ideas become working code faster than ever before. But speed without understanding produces poor results—Garbage In, Garbage Out is more relevant than ever.

MISI addresses this by combining **two foundational curriculum tracks** with **hands-on project work**:

| Track | Focus | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **[SWE Fundamentals](course/swe/)** | Software engineering principles, tools, practices | Ensures students can collaborate professionally and maintain code quality |
| **[LLM Fundamentals](course/llm/)** | Effective use of AI coding assistants | Teaches students to direct AI tools with judgment and accountability |

These tracks are **front-loaded during a 2-day bootcamp** in Week 1, then **woven through Weeks 2-4** as just-in-time learning while students build real projects.

## Program Structure

- **Duration**: 4 weeks (plus optional prep)
- **Team Size**: 2-4 students per team
- **Cohort Size**: 10-20 students total
- **Facilitation**: Experienced software engineers
- **Format**: In-person meetings with some remote collaboration

### Weekly Progression

| Week | Focus | Curriculum Delivery |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| **Week 1** | Bootcamp + Team Formation | Front-loaded: SWE & LLM foundations (Days 1-2), then project selection |
| **Week 2** | Build & Iterate | Just-in-time: modules delivered as teams encounter needs |
| **Week 3** | Feature Expansion | Just-in-time: advanced topics woven into project work |
| **Week 4** | Polish & Present | Capstone: ethics discussions, Demo Day, retrospective |

## Approach

This program combines **inquiry-based learning** and **cohort empowerment** inspired by the Greenwich High School [Honors Science Research (HSR)](https://www.amazon.com/Class-Life-Changing-World-Changing-Inventive-Classroom/dp/0399181849) program.

### The Three Pillars

1. **Foundational Knowledge** (SWE + LLM Tracks)
   - Two complementary curriculum tracks establish shared vocabulary and skills
   - Front-loaded bootcamp ensures all students start from common ground
   - Just-in-time delivery reinforces learning when it's most relevant

2. **AI-Assisted Development**
   - Students use tools like Claude Code from day one
   - Emphasis on directing AI with intent, not just accepting output
   - Critical evaluation and verification of AI-generated code

3. **Inquiry-Based Project Focus**
   - Students select and scope their own projects
   - Self-directed teams with mentor guidance
   - Full lifecycle from idea to deployed product

### Development Philosophy

We embrace the thesis that AI tools enable a new form of development where most code is generated by machine intelligence. In this mode:

- Teams focus on **product quality**—what to build and why
- Sound engineering principles ensure **software quality**—how to build it well
- AI handles **implementation speed**—but humans remain accountable for the result

## Goals

1. Establish foundational knowledge through two complementary curriculum tracks
2. Teach students to apply AI technologies effectively and responsibly
3. Foster individual growth through team-based project work
4. Enable students to build and ship real software projects
5. Openly document progress so others may learn from this approach
