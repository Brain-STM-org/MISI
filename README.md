# Machine Intelligence Senior Internship (MISI)

A 5-week internship program for graduating high school seniors to explore new models of software development.

## Overview

Many high schools require either a Senior Project or an Internship experience to graduate, typically occurring during the last few weeks of school in May and early June. Software engineering is in an LLM-assisted renaissance, where the transmutation of idea formation to code generation happens extremely quickly. New models for working on projects are emerging, but without understanding software engineering principles, quality suffers. Garbage In, Garbage Out is more relevant than ever.

## Program Structure

- **Duration**: 5 weeks
- **Team Size**: 2-4 students per team
- **Cohort Size**: 10-20 students total
- **Facilitation**: Experienced software engineers
- **Format**: In-person meetings (daily or thrice weekly) with some remote interaction

## Approach

This program combines inquiry-based learning and cohort empowerment inspired by the Greenwich High School [Honors Science Research (HSR)](https://www.amazon.com/Class-Life-Changing-World-Changing-Inventive-Classroom/dp/0399181849) program.

### Key Elements

1. **Project Selection**: The cohort identifies a set of software projects
2. **Self-Assignment**: Students choose projects based on interest and capability
3. **Full Lifecycle**: Projects go from seed concept to final product over 5 weeks
4. **AI-Assisted Development**: Explicit leverage of tools like AntiGravity and Claude Code

### Development Philosophy

We embrace the thesis that AI tools are the root of a new form of development, wherein most code is generated by machine intelligence. In this mode:

- Teams are freer to focus on **product quality**
- Sound and proven software engineering principles ensure **software quality**
- Continuous research, documentation, and reflection on our approach

## Goals

1. Provide students with a unique learning experience
2. Help students understand how to apply AI technologies in software development
3. Foster individual growth while working as a team
4. Enable deep dives into specific projects
5. Openly document progress so others may learn from this approach
