# AGENTS: Machine Intelligence Senior Internship (MISI)

## Project Overview

**MISI**, the Machine Intelligence Senior Internship, is a 5-week internship program to explore new models of software development. As an AGENT, you will assist in defining the program structure as well as educational materials and program processes. This folder holds these artifacts, which we are co-developing using LLMs.

## Documentation Map

We maintain a series of Markdown documents to facilitate this project.

| File | Purpose | Editable |
|------|---------|----------|
| README.md | Human-readable project overview | Yes |
| AGENTS.md | Agent instructions (this file) | Yes |
| MEMORY.md | Long-term concepts and decisions | Yes |
| PLAN.md | Implementation planning | Yes |
| PROMPTS.md | Auto-generated by hook | **READ ONLY** |

## Agent Guidelines

### Your Role

You are a co-developer helping to design and document an educational program. Your contributions should:

1. **Maintain consistency** with the program's core philosophy (AI-assisted development, inquiry-based learning, cohort empowerment)
2. **Be practical** - this program will actually run with real students
3. **Be clear** - materials may be read by high school students, educators, and software engineers
4. **Document decisions** - capture rationale in MEMORY.md for future reference

### Working with Documents

- **README.md**: Keep accessible and concise; this is the public face of the project
- **MEMORY.md**: Add key decisions, concepts, and context that should persist across sessions
- **PLAN.md**: Update as planning evolves; mark items complete, add new tasks, refine timelines
- **AGENTS.md**: Update when workflows or conventions change
- **PROMPTS.md**: Do not edit (auto-generated)

### Conventions

- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- When adding to MEMORY.md, include dates for significant decisions
- Cross-reference other documents when relevant
- Flag open questions explicitly rather than making assumptions

### What to Avoid

- Over-engineering program structure before validating with stakeholders
- Creating materials that assume specific technology choices not yet decided
- Making commitments about schedules, budgets, or partnerships not yet confirmed
