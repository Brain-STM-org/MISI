# PLAN: Machine Intelligence Senior Internship (MISI)

## Implementation Timeline

### Pre-Program (Weeks -4 to -1)

#### Logistics

- [ ] Finalize partnership with target high school(s)
- [ ] Recruit and onboard facilitating software engineers
- [ ] Define project portfolio and selection criteria
- [ ] Set up collaboration infrastructure (repos, communication tools)
- [ ] Create assessment rubrics and milestone definitions
- [ ] Coordinate schedules and secure meeting space
- [ ] Write code of conduct for participants and facilitators

#### Curriculum Development

Detailed curriculum planning lives in course-specific PLAN.md files:

**Software Engineering Track** → See `course/swe/PLAN.md`
- 16 modules complete, ~8-10 hours total content
- Remaining: hands-on exercises, assessment materials, instructor guides

**LLM-Assisted Development Track** → See `course/llm/PLAN.md`
- 18 modules defined, ~13-15 hours total content
- Research phase complete (Simon Willison, Jan 2026)
- Module development in progress (sequential from Module 00)

**Cross-Track Integration**
- [ ] Create unified bootcamp schedule weaving both tracks
- [ ] Cross-reference SWE testing with LLM verification practices
- [ ] Design workshop materials for Claude Code and AntiGravity
- [ ] Create project scaffolding templates with CI/CD pre-configured

### Week 1: Foundation & Team Formation

**Theme**: Orientation, team building, project selection, and first code

- [ ] Cohort orientation and introductions
- [ ] Core software engineering principles: version control, testing mindset, code review, iterative development
- [ ] Introduction to AI-assisted development principles
- [ ] Hands-on workshop: Claude Code and AntiGravity basics
- [ ] Project pitches and team formation
- [ ] Initial project scoping and requirements gathering
- [ ] Teams begin coding with scaffolded templates (CI/CD, tests from day one)

**Deliverables**:
- Team assignments finalized
- Project charters drafted
- Development environments set up
- First commits pushed (scaffolding + initial features)

### Week 2: First Working Versions

**Theme**: Rapid iteration to MVP

In LLM-assisted development, design-code-test cycles happen in minutes, not weeks. By the end of Week 2, teams should have working software that demonstrates core functionality.

- [ ] Daily iteration cycles: prompt → generate → test → refine
- [ ] Daily standups and blockers review
- [ ] Continuous code review practices (peer + facilitator)
- [ ] First user feedback sessions (dogfooding within cohort)
- [ ] Cross-team knowledge sharing: what prompts work, what doesn't

**Deliverables**:
- Working MVP for each project
- Test suites running in CI
- Initial user feedback collected

### Week 3: Feature Expansion & Refinement

**Theme**: Broadening scope while maintaining quality

With working MVPs in hand, teams expand functionality while continuously integrating and testing. Quality is not a phase—it's constant.

- [ ] Feature prioritization based on Week 2 feedback
- [ ] Continued rapid iteration cycles
- [ ] Mid-point project reviews with facilitators
- [ ] Documentation as you go (not deferred)
- [ ] Cross-team demos and feedback exchange
- [ ] Address technical debt before it accumulates

**Deliverables**:
- Expanded feature set
- Updated documentation
- Refined UI/UX based on feedback

### Week 4: Polish & User Validation

**Theme**: Production readiness and external feedback

Teams shift focus from building new features to hardening what exists. External users (beyond the cohort) provide feedback.

- [ ] Feature freeze: focus on stability and polish
- [ ] User acceptance testing with external testers
- [ ] Performance and edge case refinement
- [ ] Presentation preparation begins
- [ ] Final documentation pass

**Deliverables**:
- Feature-complete, stable products
- External user feedback incorporated
- Draft presentations ready

### Week 5: Launch & Reflection

**Theme**: Presentation, deployment, and retrospective

- [ ] Final product polish
- [ ] Deployment to production environments
- [ ] Cohort demo day / presentations
- [ ] Individual and team retrospectives
- [ ] Documentation finalization
- [ ] Lessons learned compilation

**Deliverables**:
- Deployed products
- Final presentations delivered
- Retrospective reports
- Published learnings

## Open Questions

1. What specific high school(s) will partner with the program?
2. What is the meeting schedule (daily vs. thrice weekly)?
3. What project categories will be offered?
4. How will student assessment/grading work?
5. What is the budget for infrastructure and tools?

## Next Steps

1. Define facilitator requirements and begin recruitment
2. Establish school partnership agreements
3. Create detailed curriculum for Week 1
4. Set up project repository templates
5. Develop AI tool training materials
