# MEMORY: Machine Intelligence Senior Internship (MISI)

This document captures long-term context, key decisions, and foundational concepts for the MISI program. Update this file when important decisions are made or context needs to be preserved across sessions.

## Core Concept

We are building a 5-week internship program for graduating high school seniors to explore new models of software development. Many high schools require either a Senior Project or an Internship experience to graduate; this occurs during the last few weeks of school in May and early June. Software engineering is in an LLM-assisted renaissance, wherein the transmutation of idea formation to code generation happens extremely quickly. There are new models for working on projects emerging, but without understanding software engineering principles, slop will be slop. Garbage In, Garbage Out is more relevant than ever.

In this program, we will arrange students into teams of 2-4 students each, all operating under a shared cohort of 10-20 students. This program will be facilitated by experienced software engineers. While there is some remote interaction, students will meet together as teams and cohort in-person (daily? thrice weekly?)

This program combines inquiry-based learning and cohort empowerment that is inspired by the Greenwich High School [Honors Science Research (HSR)](https://www.amazon.com/Class-Life-Changing-World-Changing-Inventive-Classroom/dp/0399181849) program. The cohort will identify a set of software projects and students will self-assign based on interest and capability. These projects will go from seed concept to final product over the 5 weeks.

We will explicitly leverage tools like AntiGravity and Claude Code, the thesis being that these are the root of a new form of development, wherein most of the code is generated by machine intelligence. In this mode, teams are freer to focus on product quality. But, that must also be balanced with software quality and we will apply sound and proven software engineering principles to ensure this. During the internship, we will also continually research, document, and reflect on our approach -- this process is new to the development community!

The end goal is to provide these students with a unique experience and help them gain early understanding into how students and workforce can apply these technologies and that they grow as individuals while working as a team and diving deep into a specific project.

We will openly document our progress so that others may learn from us.

## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-20 | Initial documentation structure established | Created README, PLAN, AGENTS, MEMORY, PROMPTS as core docs |
| 2026-01-20 | Weekly plan structured around product maturity, not sequential phases | In LLM-assisted development, design-code-test cycles happen in minutes, not weeks. Traditional waterfall phases (design week → dev week → test week) don't reflect reality. Testing, code review, and iteration happen daily from Week 1. Weekly themes now reflect where the product should be (MVP → expanded features → polish), not what activity dominates. |

## Foundational Principles

1. **AI-Assisted, Not AI-Replaced**: Students learn to direct AI tools, not be replaced by them
2. **Quality Over Speed**: AI enables faster development, but software engineering principles still apply
3. **Inquiry-Based Learning**: Students drive project selection and problem-solving
4. **Cohort Empowerment**: Peer learning and collaboration are central to the experience
5. **Open Documentation**: Share learnings publicly to benefit the broader community
