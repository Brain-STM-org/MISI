## The Paradox

You're about to spend four weeks in intensive communion with machine intelligence. You'll read code, write prompts, debug problems, collaborate with teammates, and build something real. It will be exhilarating. It will also be physically demanding in ways that aren't obvious.

Here's the paradox: the work is mental, but it happens in a body.

Your body will sit for hours. Your eyes will focus on screens. Your hands will type thousands of keystrokes. Your nervous system will process the stress of learning, the frustration of bugs, the pressure of deadlines. If you ignore all of this — if you treat your body as a mere vehicle for your mind — you will pay a price. Maybe in back pain. Maybe in wrist strain. Maybe in foggy thinking. Maybe in burnout.

The students who thrive aren't the ones who push hardest. They're the ones who sustain.

## What This Curriculum Offers

This is not a wellness program. It's a **capability program**.

The practices in these modules directly support your ability to do the work:

- **Physical setup** (Module 1) prevents the strain that accumulates into injury and distraction
- **Breath techniques** (Module 2) give you a manual override for your stress response
- **Movement practices** (Module 3) clear mental fog and maintain a body that can sit for focused work
- **Work rhythms** (Module 4) structure your day for sustainable high performance
- **Presence practices** (Module 5) improve how you collaborate and communicate

This isn't about balance or self-care as abstract virtues. It's about building a foundation that lets you work longer, think clearer, and create better.

## How to Use This Material

**During bootcamp week:** You'll learn the essentials through facilitated sessions embedded in the daily rhythm. Pay attention. The habits you build this week will carry you through the project phase.

**During project work:** Return to these materials when you need them. The desk flow in Module 3 is designed for daily use. The breath reset in Module 2 is your go-to intervention when stressed or stuck. The rhythm guidelines in Module 4 help you structure sustainable days.

**For deeper exploration:** Each module ends with "Going Deeper" — pointers for those who want to explore the traditions and research behind these practices. This is optional. The core practices work without understanding their origins.

## A Note on Depth

Some of you will take what works and leave the rest. You'll do the stretches because they help your back, use the breathing because it clears your head, and never think about it more deeply. That's completely valid.

Some of you will discover that these practices open doors to something more — a different relationship with your body, your mind, your work. The deeper traditions from which these practices come are available to you if you want them.

Both paths are honored here. We offer tools. You choose which to use and how far to take them.

## The Core Insight

Your capacity is not fixed. It's cultivated.

The developers who build great things over long careers aren't superhuman. They've learned to maintain themselves — to work with their biology instead of against it, to recover as deliberately as they focus, to treat their physical and mental health as infrastructure rather than afterthought.

This curriculum teaches the foundations of that maintenance. Start now, when the habits are easy to build. Your future self will thank you.

## Let's Begin

Turn to Module 1: Your Physical Setup. We start with the foundation — how you arrange your body in space.

Everything else builds from there.
