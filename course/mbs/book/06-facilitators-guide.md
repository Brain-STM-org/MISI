# Facilitator's Guide
## Teaching the Sustainable Developer Curriculum

**Estimated reading time:** 15 minutes
**Audience:** Facilitators, mentors, and anyone teaching this material

---

## Introduction

You've been asked to guide others through the Sustainable Developer curriculum. This is not about lecturing on wellness. It's about **embodying and transmitting practices** that support sustainable high performance.

The most important thing you bring to this role is your own practice. If you use these techniques yourself, you'll teach them authentically. If you don't, students will sense the disconnect.

This guide covers how to facilitate each module, common challenges, and principles for effective mind-body instruction.

## The Facilitator's First Principle: Embody What You Teach

Students learn more from what you do than what you say.

If you lead a breath practice while seeming rushed, the message is: "This isn't really important." If you skip movement breaks when running behind, you teach: "This is optional when things get busy." If you respond to difficult questions with defensiveness, you contradict everything in Module 5.

**Before facilitating, ask yourself:**
- Do I have my own breath practice?
- Do I take movement breaks in my own work?
- Do I protect my sleep?
- Do I practice presence in my own conversations?

You don't need to be perfect. You need to be practicing. Authenticity matters more than expertise.

## Integration Model: Embedded, Not Separate

This curriculum is designed to be **woven into the program**, not delivered as standalone "wellness sessions."

**Daily Rhythm Integration:**

| Time | Practice | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Start of day | Breath reset | 2 min | Transition into focus |
| 90-min mark | Desk flow | 5 min | Facilitator-led |
| Lunch | Protected | 45+ min | No working lunches |
| Afternoon | Desk flow | 5 min | Can be self-guided |
| End of day | Brief reflection | 3 min | What did you learn? |

**The Setup Session (Day 1):**

Before any technical content, guide students through workstation setup (Module 1). Frame it as "configuring your development environment" — they're already doing this for their code. This session also introduces the breath practice and establishes expectations for the program's rhythm.

**Micro-teachings:**

Throughout the week, drop brief (2-3 minute) explanations connecting the practices to the moment:

- Before a challenging session: "Let's take a breath before we dive in..."
- When energy is flagging: "Notice if you're breathing shallowly..."
- Before feedback exercises: "Remember, ground yourself first..."

These normalize the integration. The practices become "how we work" rather than "extra content."

## Module-by-Module Facilitation Guide

### Module 0: The Sustainable Developer

**When:** Day 1, orientation

**How:** Brief framing (5-10 minutes). Read or paraphrase the key points. Don't belabor it — students want to get started. The message is: "We take this seriously, here's why, now let's do it."

**Key points to emphasize:**
- This is about capability, not wellness
- Small practices compound
- These are tools — use what works for you

---

### Module 1: Your Physical Setup

**When:** Day 1, before technical content begins

**How:** Walk students through their workstation audit. Have them actually adjust their setups — monitor height, chair position, keyboard placement. This is hands-on, not lecture.

**Materials needed:**
- Books or boxes for monitor elevation
- Towels that can be rolled for lumbar support (if chairs lack it)
- Printed setup audit checklist

**Common issues:**
- Laptops without external monitors (discuss tradeoffs, encourage frequent breaks)
- Non-adjustable furniture (work with what you have, compensate with stretches)
- "It feels weird" after adjustment (normal — new positions feel strange, give it a day)

**Your role:** Walk around, observe setups, offer individual suggestions. This is coaching, not presenting.

---

### Module 2: The Breath as Tool

**When:** Day 1 (introduction), then daily practice

**How:** Guide the first box breathing session live. Talk through the physiological mechanism briefly, then do 3-5 minutes of actual practice together. Eyes closed is fine but not required.

**Facilitation script:**
> "Find a comfortable seat. Feet flat on the floor. Hands on your thighs or belly. We're going to practice box breathing — four equal parts. Inhale for four counts... hold for four... exhale for four... hold for four. I'll count us through a few rounds, then you'll continue silently.
>
> Breathe into your belly, not your chest. If you have a hand on your belly, feel it rise with the inhale.
>
> Let's begin. Inhale... two... three... four. Hold... two... three... four. Exhale... two... three... four. Hold... two... three... four.
>
> [Repeat for 4-6 rounds with counting, then:]
>
> Now continue on your own, keeping your own count. I'll let you know when to stop.
>
> [2-3 minutes of silence]
>
> Gently release the technique. Breathe naturally. Notice how you feel. When you're ready, open your eyes."

**Common issues:**
- Students feeling silly or resistant → Normalize it: "This might feel strange. That's fine. Give it a try."
- Difficulty with belly breathing → Suggest lying down practice later
- "I don't feel anything" → "Give it a few sessions. The effects are subtle at first."

**Ongoing use:** Start every morning with 2 minutes of guided breath. This becomes ritual.

### Module 3: Movement for the Mind

**When:** Day 1 (teach the sequence), then every 90 minutes

**How:** Lead the desk flow live, demonstrating each movement. Cue breath coordination and common errors. The first time takes 10-12 minutes with instruction; subsequent sessions are 5 minutes.

**Facilitation approach:**
- Demo first, then have students follow
- Walk around during practice, offering gentle corrections
- Use language like "option to..." and "if it feels good..." to honor modifications
- Don't force anyone into positions that hurt

**Key cues:**

*Cat-Cow:* "Initiate from the pelvis, not just the middle back. Think of your spine as a wave."

*Neck:* "Keep these movements small. Your neck is delicate."

*Wrists:* "Keyboard workers — don't skip this one. Your hands are your tools."

*Hip stretch:* "Keep the foot flexed to protect the knee. You may feel this more on one side."

**Common issues:**
- Self-consciousness → Acknowledge it: "This might feel silly. Do it anyway."
- Limited mobility → Offer modifications freely: "Smaller is fine. Skip it if it hurts."
- "I don't have time" → The 2-minute version exists for this reason

**Ongoing use:** Lead the desk flow at every 90-minute break. Eventually, students can self-guide.

### Module 4: Rhythm of Deep Work

**When:** Day 1 (set expectations), reinforced throughout

**How:** This module is taught through the program's structure more than through explicit instruction. However, the sleep conversation needs direct facilitation.

**The Sleep Conversation:**

Be direct about sleep. Students may have poor habits or believe they can function on minimal sleep. The science is clear: they can't.

> "I want to talk about sleep. You might think you can function on six hours or pull all-nighters to catch up. The research is unambiguous: sleep deprivation impairs cognitive performance as much as alcohol intoxication. You will learn less, make more mistakes, and feel worse.
>
> The expectation is 7-9 hours. We will not give you work that requires sacrificing sleep. If you find yourself staying up late to finish something, something has gone wrong — talk to us rather than skipping sleep.
>
> This isn't optional. It's infrastructure."

**Modeling:**
- End sessions on time
- Don't send late-night messages
- Take your own breaks visibly
- Protect lunch

---

### Module 5: Presence in Collaboration

**When:** Before team activities begin, reinforced in context

**How:** The listening and feedback sections are best taught through structured practice, not lecture.

**Mindful Listening Exercise:**
1. Pair students
2. One person speaks for 2 minutes on a prompt (e.g., "What are you hoping to build?")
3. The listener practices full attention — no interrupting, no preparing response
4. Listener reflects back: "What I heard was..."
5. Switch roles
6. Debrief: "What was it like to be fully listened to? What was hard about listening?"

**Feedback Role-Play:**
1. Set up a scenario (e.g., "You're reviewing code and notice the logic is confusing")
2. Have students practice giving feedback using the principles (observation vs. judgment, specific, code not person)
3. The "receiver" practices breathing and listening
4. Debrief: "What worked? What landed well?"

**In context:**
Before code reviews: "Remember — observation before judgment, specific and actionable."
After difficult conversations: "How did that feel? What would you do differently?"

### Module 6: (This Guide)

If training other facilitators, walk through this guide together and do the practices. The train-the-trainer model works best when facilitators experience the material as students first.

---

## Handling Resistance

Some students will be skeptical. This is normal. Possible sources:

- **"This is woo-woo"** → Lead with science. The autonomic nervous system is measurable. Ergonomics is occupational health. Don't oversell the spiritual dimension to students who aren't interested.

- **"I don't have time"** → Point out that 5 minutes of movement is tiny compared to hours of work. The practices are efficient. The time pays for itself in focus.

- **"It feels silly"** → Acknowledge it. "Yes, doing stretches at your desk might feel silly. Do it anyway. Your back doesn't care about your dignity."

- **"I'm already healthy"** → Great. These practices maintain that. Many people who feel fine develop problems over years of desk work. Prevention is easier than treatment.

Don't argue. Invite them to try and judge by results. Most skeptics come around once they experience the effects.

## Creating Psychological Safety

Mind-body practices can feel vulnerable. Students are being asked to pay attention to their bodies, their stress, their limitations. This requires a safe environment.

**Create safety by:**
- Offering choices ("Option to close your eyes or keep them open")
- Normalizing difficulty ("It's common for the mind to race. That's not failure, that's just how minds are")
- Avoiding correction that shames ("Try adjusting your shoulders" rather than "You're doing it wrong")
- Honoring boundaries (no one should be forced into positions they don't want)
- Managing your own reactivity (Module 5 applies to you too)

---

## When to Refer

Some students may have challenges beyond what this curriculum addresses:

- **Chronic pain** that doesn't respond to ergonomic adjustment → Encourage them to see a healthcare provider
- **Sleep disorders** that persist despite good hygiene → May need professional assessment
- **Anxiety** that's significantly impairing function → Suggest speaking with a counselor
- **Physical limitations** requiring adapted instruction → Work with them on modifications, don't push into pain

You're a facilitator, not a therapist. Know your scope and refer appropriately.

---

## The Long Game

You're not just teaching a curriculum. You're planting seeds.

Some students will adopt these practices and carry them forward for years. Some will forget everything the moment the program ends. Most will fall somewhere in between — retaining what resonated, applying it when they remember, gradually developing their own relationship with sustainable practice.

Your job is to offer the tools with skill and care. What they do with them is up to them.

---

## Facilitator Self-Care

Teaching this material while not caring for yourself is a recipe for burnout and inauthenticity.

**Your own practice matters:**
- Maintain your breath practice
- Take your movement breaks (even when facilitating)
- Protect your sleep
- Notice when you're depleted and rest

**Support structures:**
- Connect with other facilitators
- Seek your own mentorship
- Reflect on what's working and what isn't
- Adapt based on your experience

You can't pour from an empty cup. Model the sustainability you're teaching.

## Quick Reference for Facilitators

**Daily checklist:**
- [ ] Morning breath practice (2 min)
- [ ] 90-minute movement breaks (5 min each)
- [ ] Protected lunch
- [ ] Micro-teachings woven into content
- [ ] End-of-day reflection

**Watch for:**
- Students slumping at workstations → Invite posture check
- Energy dropping after lunch → Lead movement break
- Tension before difficult tasks → Brief breath practice
- Resistance or skepticism → Meet with curiosity, not defensiveness

**Remember:**
- Embody what you teach
- Less lecture, more practice
- Create safety for vulnerability
- Refer when needed
- Care for yourself too

---

## Closing

Teaching is a practice in itself. Each session teaches you something about what works, what doesn't, what resonates with this group in this moment.

Approach facilitating with the same presence you're teaching. Listen to your students. Adapt to what you observe. Be honest about what you don't know. Keep practicing.

The goal is not perfect delivery. It's authentic transmission of practices that support human flourishing. If you care about that — and you're doing your own work — the teaching will find its way.

Thank you for taking on this role. The students are lucky to have someone willing to guide them toward sustainability.

Now go practice.
