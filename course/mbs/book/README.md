## Structure

The curriculum is designed for **embedded integration**, not standalone delivery:

- **Bootcamp Week (Tier 1):** Essential foundations taught through facilitated sessions woven into the daily rhythm. ~2 hours total across the week.

- **Project Phase (Tier 2-3):** Self-directed deepening. Students return to materials as needed. Optional guided sessions available.

## Daily Rhythm

| Time | Practice |
|------|----------|
| Morning | 2-min breath reset |
| Every 90 min | 5-min desk flow |
| Lunch | 45+ min away from desk |
| End of day | Brief reflection |

## Key Practices

### The 2-Minute Breath Reset
Box breathing (4-4-4-4) for nervous system regulation. Use before work, when stuck, during breaks.

### The 5-Minute Desk Flow
Seated movement sequence for physical maintenance. Do every 90 minutes.

### The Sustainable Day
90-minute focused blocks → real breaks → protected lunch → 7-9 hours sleep.
