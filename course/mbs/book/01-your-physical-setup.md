## Introduction

Before you write a single line of code, before you craft your first prompt, you'll make a decision that will shape every hour of your work: how you arrange your body in space.

This isn't about optimization or biohacking. It's about something simpler: **not hurting yourself**.

The human body didn't evolve for hours of keyboard work. Our ancestors walked, climbed, carried, squatted — they rarely sat still for extended periods staring at a fixed point. When we ask our bodies to do something they weren't designed for, we need to be thoughtful about how we do it.

The good news: small adjustments make enormous differences. A monitor raised two inches can eliminate chronic neck pain. A keyboard moved three inches can prevent years of wrist problems. This module gives you the knowledge to set up your workspace well, and the understanding to adapt when circumstances aren't ideal.

## The Science of Sitting

When you sit, several things happen in your body:

**Your spine compresses.** The discs between your vertebrae bear more load sitting than standing. Poor posture multiplies this load — a forward head position can add 40+ pounds of effective weight to your neck.

**Your hip flexors shorten.** These muscles at the front of your hip adapt to the seated position, becoming tight. Tight hip flexors pull on the lower spine, contributing to back pain and affecting your ability to stand and walk comfortably.

**Your circulation slows.** Blood pools in the legs. The heart works against gravity without the assistance of walking muscles. Over years, this contributes to cardiovascular stress.

**Your breathing shallows.** A collapsed posture compresses the lungs and diaphragm. Less oxygen reaches the brain. Cognitive function subtly degrades.

None of this means sitting is evil — it means **how** you sit matters, and **how long** you sit without interruption matters even more.

## Neutral Spine: Your North Star

The goal of ergonomic setup is to support **neutral spine** — the natural S-curve of a healthy back. In neutral spine:

- Your ears are over your shoulders
- Your shoulders are over your hips
- Your lower back has a gentle inward curve (lordosis)
- Your pelvis is neither tucked under nor excessively tilted

When neutral spine is supported by your chair and maintained by your awareness, the muscles of your back can relax. They're not fighting gravity; they're balanced. This is the posture you can sustain.

**The test:** If you need to use effort to hold your posture, something is wrong with your setup. Good ergonomics feels easy.

## Setting Up Your Workstation

Work through each element in order. Small adjustments compound.

### 1. Chair Height

Sit with your feet flat on the floor (or on a footrest). Your thighs should be parallel to the ground or angled slightly down. Your knees should be at approximately 90 degrees.

*If your chair is too high:* Your feet dangle, pressure builds under your thighs, circulation is impaired.

*If your chair is too low:* Your knees are higher than your hips, your pelvis tilts backward, your lower back rounds.

**If your chair isn't adjustable:** A cushion can raise seat height; a footrest can compensate if the seat is too high. A rolled towel behind your lower back can provide lumbar support.

### 2. Chair Depth

There should be a 2-3 finger gap between the edge of the seat and the back of your knees. If the seat is too deep, you'll either round your back to reach the backrest or perch on the edge without support.

### 3. Lumbar Support

Your lower back's inward curve should be gently supported. Many chairs have adjustable lumbar support. If yours doesn't, a small cushion or rolled towel can work.

The support should fill the curve without pushing you forward. Too much support is as problematic as none.

### 4. Monitor Position

**Height:** The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level. You should be looking slightly downward at the center of the screen. This is the natural resting position of the eyes.

*Too low:* Your head tilts forward and down. Your neck strains. This is the most common monitor error.

*Too high:* Your head tilts back. Your neck still strains, and your eyes dry out faster.

**Distance:** The screen should be about arm's length away (18-24 inches). You should be able to read text comfortably without leaning forward.

**Angle:** The screen should be perpendicular to your line of sight, or tilted back very slightly. Avoid glare from windows or lights.

**For laptop users:** This is the hardest setup to get right. A laptop's screen and keyboard are connected, so optimizing one compromises the other. Solutions:
- External monitor + laptop keyboard (best)
- Laptop stand + external keyboard (good)
- Accept the compromise and take more frequent breaks (acceptable)

**For dual monitors:** Position your primary monitor directly ahead. Place the secondary at an angle to minimize neck rotation. If you use both equally, center the gap between them on your nose.

### 5. Keyboard Position

Your keyboard should be at a height where your elbows are at approximately 90 degrees when typing, with your forearms parallel to the ground. Your wrists should be neutral — not bent up, down, or to the side.

*Keyboard too high:* Shoulders hunch, tension builds in neck and upper back.

*Keyboard too low:* Wrists bend upward, straining the tendons.

Many people benefit from a **negative tilt** — the back of the keyboard lower than the front. This keeps wrists neutral. Those little feet on the back of your keyboard? Consider leaving them folded.

### 6. Mouse Position

Keep your mouse close to your keyboard. Reaching to the side strains the shoulder. Your arm should be relaxed at your side, elbow at 90 degrees, wrist neutral.

If you use a mouse heavily, consider:
- Learning keyboard shortcuts to reduce mouse use
- Alternating hands periodically
- A trackpad, trackball, or vertical mouse as alternatives

### 7. Document Position

If you reference physical documents, use a document holder at the same height and distance as your monitor. Looking down repeatedly strains the neck.

## Your Hands and Wrists: Special Care

Keyboard workers face particular risk to the hands, wrists, and forearms. The tendons that control your fingers run through a narrow passage at the wrist — the carpal tunnel. Repetitive motion, poor positioning, and inadequate rest can inflame these tendons, causing pain, numbness, and potentially chronic injury.

**Prevention principles:**

1. **Neutral wrist position** — no bending in any direction while typing
2. **Light touch** — strike keys gently, don't pound
3. **Float your wrists** — avoid resting wrists on hard surfaces while actively typing (rest only during pauses)
4. **Take breaks** — your hands need rest more than any other part of your setup
5. **Stretch** — regular wrist and forearm stretches (covered in Module 3)

[DIAGRAM: Wrist positions — correct vs. incorrect]

**Warning signs to take seriously:**
- Tingling or numbness in fingers
- Pain that persists after breaks
- Weakness in grip
- Pain that wakes you at night

If you experience these, reduce your workload, improve your setup, and consider consulting a healthcare provider. Early intervention prevents chronic problems.

## Eye Care: The 20-20-20 Rule

Your eyes aren't designed for fixed-distance focus. When you stare at a screen, the muscles that focus your lens are held in constant contraction. Over time, this causes strain, headaches, and potentially contributes to myopia (nearsightedness).

**The 20-20-20 Rule:**

Every **20 minutes**, look at something **20 feet away** for **20 seconds**.

This relaxes the focusing muscles and reminds your eyes that the world has depth. You can combine this with a brief moment of breath awareness — a micro-reset for both eyes and mind.

**Additional eye care:**

- **Blink consciously.** Screen focus reduces blink rate, drying eyes. Deliberately blink when you notice dryness.
- **Adjust screen brightness** to match your environment. Too bright or too dim both strain.
- **Consider blue light.** The evidence on blue light glasses is mixed, but reducing screen brightness in evening hours supports sleep regardless.
- **Ensure adequate lighting.** Working in darkness with a bright screen is hard on eyes.

## Standing Desks: When and How

Standing is not the opposite of sitting — they're both static postures. The goal is **variation**, not replacement.

**If you have a standing desk:**

- Don't stand all day. Alternate sitting and standing.
- Start with 20-30 minutes standing per hour, adjust based on comfort.
- Wear supportive shoes or use an anti-fatigue mat.
- Apply the same ergonomic principles: monitor at eye level, keyboard at elbow height, neutral spine.
- Shift your weight. Standing still is almost as bad as sitting still.

**The transition dance:** When you change from sitting to standing (or back), take 30 seconds to reset your posture consciously. Adjust your monitor. Roll your shoulders. Take a breath. The transition itself is an opportunity for presence.

## The Minimal Viable Setup

Sometimes you'll work in imperfect conditions — a coffee shop, a couch, a library with bad chairs. Here's how to adapt:

1. **Prioritize wrist position.** If you can't get everything right, protect your hands.
2. **Raise your laptop.** Stack books under it if needed. Accept that you'll need an external keyboard for extended sessions.
3. **Set a timer.** In poor setups, take breaks more frequently — every 20-30 minutes.
4. **Don't stay long.** Use good setups for long sessions, tolerate bad setups only briefly.
5. **Stretch more.** What your setup doesn't provide, your movement practice must compensate for.

## Your Setup Audit

Take 10 minutes to audit your current workspace:

| Element | Ideal | Your Current Setup | Adjustment Needed |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chair height | Feet flat, thighs parallel | | |
| Chair depth | 2-3 finger gap | | |
| Lumbar support | Fills lower back curve | | |
| Monitor height | Top at/below eye level | | |
| Monitor distance | Arm's length | | |
| Keyboard height | Elbows at 90° | | |
| Wrist position | Neutral, floating | | |
| Mouse position | Close to keyboard | | |

Make one adjustment today. Notice how it feels tomorrow. Good ergonomics is iterative — you tune over time as you develop body awareness.

## Going Deeper

The principles in this module come from the intersection of occupational health science and somatic awareness traditions. If you want to explore further:

- **The research:** Search for "office ergonomics OSHA" for evidence-based guidelines
- **The somatic perspective:** The Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais Method offer deeper exploration of posture and movement
- **The yogic view:** In yoga, asana (posture) is not just physical — it's the seat from which we engage the world. A stable, comfortable seat supports everything that follows

Your workstation is your asana for this work. Set it well.
