# AI Assistant Guidance for course/llm

This file provides context for AI assistants working on curriculum materials in this folder.

## Scope

This folder contains the Large-Language Model Assisted (LLM-Assisted) development curriculum for MISI (Machine Intelligence Senior Internship). Materials here teach foundational Artifiial Intelligence concepts to high school seniors who may have no prior programming experience.  We often refer to it as Machine Intelligence because AI is so hyped.

## Content Guidelines

### Audience Awareness
- **No jargon without explanation**: Define terms on first use
- **Analogy-first**: Connect technical concepts to familiar experiences (redlining documents, saving game checkpoints, etc.)
- **Hands-on bias**: Every concept should have a practical exercise
- **Mentor-supported**: Materials assume a skilled engineer is available to help

### File Types
- **Markdown (.md)**: Concept explanations, reference materials, instructor notes
- **HTML + TypeScript**: Interactive presentations and exercises
- **Keep files focused**: One topic per file, prefer many small files over few large ones

### Tone
- Direct and practical, not academic
- Respect student intelligence while not assuming knowledge
- Emphasize "why" before "how"
- Acknowledge that these skills apply beyond coding (business, science, any collaborative work)

## Topic Coverage

This is the LLM-Assisted Development track. A parallel Software Engineering Fundamentals track exists separately. Both can be followed independently; the bootcamp syllabus weaves them together.

TODO: We need to develop this section.   It will be similar in layout to the Topic Coverage in course/swe/AGENTS.md
It is the critical foundation for moving fast but well in a highly vibe-coded project.

 * brief history of AI to this point
 * capabilities of modern LLMs (multi-modal, reasoning, agentic loops)
 * what they are good at and when to use them
 * Everything is different since November 2025: Gemini Pro 3 and Claude Opus 4.5
 * modern developer workflows
 * whatever simon thinks we should push

## Technical Standards

- HTML presentations should work offline (no CDN dependencies in final form)
- TypeScript for any interactive components
- Accessible design (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast)
- Mobile-friendly where practical
