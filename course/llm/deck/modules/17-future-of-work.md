# The Profession Is Changing

Software development has always evolved:

| Era | Major Shift | Developer Response |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| 1970s-80s | High-level languages | Adapted from assembly |
| 1990s | Internet/web | Learned new paradigms |
| 2000s | Mobile/cloud | New platforms |
| 2010s | DevOps/agile | New workflows |
| 2020s | AI-assisted | **You are here** |

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
Each shift felt disruptive. Each required adaptation. Each created opportunities.

# What's Actually Changing

Tasks and skills

---

# Tasks Becoming Faster

AI accelerates:

| Task | Before AI | With AI |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Boilerplate code | Write from scratch | Generate and modify |
| Documentation | Manual | Draft and refine |
| Test writing | Tedious | Faster generation |
| Code review | All manual | AI-assisted review |
| Debugging | Trial and error | Guided diagnosis |

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
Not the end of these tasks — a change in how they're done.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Tasks becoming faster.
-->

# Tasks Remaining Human

Some things AI doesn't replace:

| Human Capability | Why AI Doesn't Replace It |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Understanding the problem** | Requires human context |
| **Making tradeoffs** | Requires human judgment |
| **Stakeholder communication** | Requires relationships |
| **Ethical decisions** | Requires accountability |
| **Innovation** | Requires creativity |
| **System ownership** | Requires responsibility |

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-blue-900 rounded">
AI is a tool. Humans define what to build and why.

# The New Skill Stack

What effective developers need:

| Skill Category | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| **Traditional** | Problem solving, logic, algorithms |
| **AI collaboration** | Prompting, verification, iteration |
| **Judgment** | When to use AI, when not to |
| **Communication** | Explaining decisions, working with teams |
| **Learning** | Adapting to new tools, staying current |

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
The stack expanded, not replaced.

# Career Implications

What this means for you

---

# Short Term (1-2 Years)

<v-clicks>

- Learn to use AI tools effectively
- Develop verification and judgment skills
- Build portfolio showing human+AI collaboration

</v-clicks>

<!--
Short term implications.
-->

---

# Medium Term (2-5 Years)

<v-clicks>

- AI tools become standard; expertise differentiates
- Understanding AI capabilities becomes expected
- Human skills (communication, judgment) grow in value

</v-clicks>

<!--
Medium term implications.
-->

---

# Long Term (5+ Years)

<v-clicks>

- Prediction is hard; adaptability matters
- Those who learn continuously will thrive
- Technical foundation remains valuable

</v-clicks>

<!--
Long term implications.
-->

---

# What Won't Save You

<v-clicks>

- Refusing to learn AI tools (falls behind)
- Over-relying on AI tools (skills atrophy)
- Assuming current skills are enough forever
- Waiting for clarity before adapting

</v-clicks>

<!--
What won't save you.
-->

---

# What Will Help

<v-clicks>

- Continuous learning mindset
- Strong fundamentals (they transfer)
- Practicing judgment and verification
- Building human skills alongside technical

# The Broader Picture

Beyond individual careers

---

# Economic Effects

AI affects more than individual developers:

| Level | Effect | Consideration |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Individual | Productivity changes | Your career adaptation |
| Team | Workflow changes | How teams coordinate |
| Company | Economics of software | Build vs. buy decisions |
| Industry | What's economically viable | New products possible |
| Society | Employment patterns | Larger conversation |

<!--
Economic effects at multiple levels.
-->

---

# Environmental Considerations

AI systems have environmental costs:

<v-clicks>

- Training requires significant compute
- Inference (every query) uses energy
- Data centers have carbon footprints

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
Awareness of costs helps inform choices without requiring opt-out.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Environmental considerations.

---

# Uneven Distribution

AI benefits aren't equally distributed:

<v-clicks>

- Access varies by geography and economics
- Quality of tools varies by what you can afford
- Training data represents some communities better
- Job displacement affects different groups differently

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
Being aware of disparities matters as you shape how AI is built and used.
</div>
