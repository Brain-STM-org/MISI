# SWE Curriculum Development Plan

## Overview

Software engineering fundamentals curriculum for MISI's bootcamp week and embedded throughout the 4-week program. Materials establish shared vocabulary and practices that teams use throughout their projects.

This is one of two parallel content tracks:
- **SWE Fundamentals** (this track) - Core engineering principles, tools, and practices
- **LLM-Assisted Development** (separate track) - Effective use of AI coding assistants

Both tracks are designed to be followed independently. The bootcamp syllabus weaves them together appropriately, but the SWE track is valuable for anyone (including experienced SWEs new to LLM-assisted workflows).

## 4-Week Program Structure

| Week | Theme | SWE Curriculum Role |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| **Weekend Before** | Kick-off | Prep homework (Module 00) |
| **Week 1** | Bootcamp + Team Formation | Core training (Tiers 1-2), Iterative Design |
| **Weeks 2-3** | Build | Just-in-time professional practices |
| **Week 4** | Polish + Present | Ethics discussion, demo prep |

### Module Delivery Classification

|----------|---------|------|
| **Front-loaded** (Days 1-2) | 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 08, 12 | Before project work begins |
| **Just-in-time** (Weeks 2-3) | 07, 09, 10, 11, 13, 14 | When teams encounter relevant needs |
| **Capstone** (Week 4) | 15 | Reflection before Demo Day |

## Detailed Delivery Timeline

### Pre-Program: Kick-off Weekend

Light-touch welcome event:
- Introductions and tone-setting
- **Homework assigned**: Module 00 (Development Environment setup)
- Ensure everyone arrives Day 1 ready to work

### Week 1, Days 1-2: Core Skills Bootcamp

**Day 1: Foundations** (~5 hours)

| Time | Content | Module |
|------|---------|--------|
| Morning | Development environment check | 00 (verify homework) |
| | What is source code? | 01 |
| | GitHub account setup | 02 |

## Development Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Review and finalize topic inclusion list
- [x] Complete all 16 modules (Tiers 1-3)
- [x] Build interactive demos (diffs, branches)
- [x] Restructure for 4-week program

### Remaining
- [ ] Design hands-on exercises for each module
- [ ] Assessment/quiz materials
- [ ] Instructor notes and facilitation guides
- [ ] Integrate with LLM track syllabus

---

## Open Questions

1. **Programming language for examples?**
   - Python is accessible but may not match all project types
   - Could use pseudocode or multiple languages
   - TypeScript aligns with web-focused projects

2. **Assessment strategy?**
   - Completion-based (did they do it?)
   - Competency-based (can they explain it?)
   - Portfolio evidence (apply it to their project)

---

## Notes

- All materials work for students with zero programming background
- Skilled mentor support assumed; materials support, not replace, guidance
- Principles apply beyond coding: marketing, science, business projects
- LLM curriculum is a parallel track; bootcamp syllabus integrates both
- 4-week duration (GHS requirement: minimum 25 hours/week, logged via SchoolLinks)
