# Software Engineering Fundamentals

This folder contains curriculum materials for teaching software engineering principles to MISI participants.

## Audience

- High school seniors with strong STEM backgrounds
- Programming experience not assumed
- Guided by experienced software engineer mentors
- Project focus: computing, data analysis, science, business/marketing

## Philosophy

Software engineering principles are universal. Whether building a data pipeline, a marketing dashboard, or a scientific simulation, the same fundamentals apply:

- **Persistence matters**: Every professional domain uses some form of revision control (lawyers call it redlining, accountants call it audit trails)
- **Iteration is normal**: Good software emerges through cycles of build, test, learn, refine
- **Collaboration requires structure**: Teams need shared conventions to work together effectively
- **AI amplifies, humans direct**: LLM-assisted development makes these principles more important, not less

## Delivery

Materials in this folder are delivered during the first days of the program, with hands-on exercises integrated throughout. Students will:

1. Create and configure GitHub accounts
2. Practice core workflows with real repositories
3. Apply principles immediately to their team projects

## Contents

- `AGENTS.md` - AI assistant guidance for this folder
