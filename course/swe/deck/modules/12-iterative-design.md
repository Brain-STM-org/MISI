# Opening Quote

<div class="text-2xl italic text-gray-300 mt-12">
"If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."

Imperfect but shipped beats perfect but imaginary.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

<v-clicks>

1. **Explain** why iteration beats perfection
2. **Define** a minimum viable product (MVP)
3. **Plan** projects as expanding versions
4. **Embrace** feedback as fuel
5. **Resist** the perfectionism that prevents shipping

</v-clicks>

<!--
This module addresses mindset, not just mechanics.
Particularly relevant for high-ability students.

# The Trap

Perfection prevents shipping

---

# The Vision

You have a project idea. In your mind, you see:

<v-clicks>

- Beautiful UI
- Every feature
- Handles every edge case
- Polished and professional

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

So you start building toward that vision...

</v-click>

<!--
The clear vision is seductive.
It also prevents shipping.
-->

---

# Six Weeks Later

<v-clicks>

- Half of one feature built
- It's not quite right
- You keep tweaking
- Deadline approaches
- Nothing is working
- **Panic**

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-red-900 rounded">
<strong>The perfection trap:</strong> The vision was so clear that you couldn't accept anything less. So you shipped nothing.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
This is a common failure mode.
Especially for capable students.

# The Alternative

Iterate your way to success

---

# The Iterative Path

<v-clicks>

**Week 1:** Build the simplest possible version. It works but it's ugly.

**Week 2:** Show it to someone. They have feedback. Add the most important thing.

**Week 3:** More feedback. More improvements. Core features complete.

**Week 4:** Polish what exists. Ship.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-green-900 rounded">
<strong>Result:</strong> Something actually working, informed by real feedback, focused on what matters, delivered on time.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Iteration produces real results.
Not everything imagined, but something real.
-->

---

# The MVP

**Minimum Viable Product**: The smallest thing that:

<v-clicks>

1. **Works** (actually functions)
2. **Solves** the core problem
3. **Can be used** by real people
4. **Provides feedback** for what to build next

</v-clicks>

<!--
MVP is not about cutting corners.
It's about learning what matters.
-->

---

# MVP Example

**Project idea:** Task management app

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-4">

<div>

**Full vision:**
- Multiple boards, lists
- Drag-and-drop
- Team collaboration
- Due dates, reminders
- Mobile app
- Calendar integration
- AI suggestions

</div>

<div v-click>

**MVP:**
- A single list
- Add tasks
- Mark complete
- Delete tasks

*That's it.*

</div>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
Does it solve tracking tasks? Yes. Start there.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
The MVP is deliberately small.
It validates the core value proposition.
-->

---

# Real Example: Instagram

Instagram launched in 2010 with:

<v-clicks>

- Take a photo
- Apply a filter
- Post it
- See posts from people you follow

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

No DMs. No Stories. No Reels. No shopping. No ads.

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
They shipped and learned. Now it's worth billions.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Instagram didn't imagine every feature first.
They validated core value, then expanded.

# Why Iteration Works

---

# You Learn What Matters

Your guesses about what users want are often wrong.

<v-click>

```
Build → Show → "That button is confusing" → Fix → Repeat
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-blue-900 rounded">
Real feedback beats imagined requirements.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Users reveal what you couldn't predict.
Learning requires showing work.
-->

---

# You Reduce Risk

<v-clicks>

**Six weeks building the wrong thing?**
→ Six weeks wasted.

**One week building an MVP, discover it's wrong?**
→ One week lost. Pivot and try again.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 text-xl">
Small iterations = small mistakes = quick corrections
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Iteration is risk management.
Small bets, fast feedback.
-->

---

# You Maintain Momentum

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

**Shipping creates:**
- Visible progress
- Feedback that gives direction
- Team morale
- Energy

</div>

<div v-click>

**Endless building creates:**
- Doubt
- Feature creep
- Burnout
- Abandonment

</div>

</div>

<!--
Momentum matters.
Shipping maintains it.
-->

---

# The Iteration Cycle

```
Plan → Build → Ship → Learn
  ↑                     │
  └─────────────────────┘
```

<v-clicks>

**V1.0** (MVP): Core functionality

*Feedback: "I wish it could..."*

**V1.1**: Add most-requested feature

*Feedback: "This part is confusing"*

**V1.2**: Improve UX based on feedback

</v-clicks>

<!--
Each cycle is short.
Days or a week, not months.

# Your MISI Project

Four weeks, iterative approach

---

# Week by Week

| Week | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Define + Build MVP | Ugly but working by Friday |
| 2 | First feedback loop | Add highest-priority improvement |
| 3 | Expand + refine | Feature freeze by Friday |
| 4 | Polish + ship | No new features, just quality |

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
You're shipping something <strong>usable</strong> by end of week 1.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
This is the MISI iteration framework.
Ship early, improve continuously.

# Fighting Perfectionism

This section is for high-ability students

---

# The Perfectionism Mindset

<v-clicks>

- "It's not ready until it's perfect"
- "I'll be judged on the quality"
- "I need to think through everything first"
- "What if someone finds a flaw?"

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
These thoughts feel responsible. They're actually fear wearing a mask.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Perfectionism is common in capable students.
It's fear disguised as responsibility.
-->

---

# The Iteration Mindset

<v-clicks>

- "Done is better than perfect"
- "I'll learn more from shipping than planning"
- "Feedback will reveal what I couldn't anticipate"
- "Flaws discovered are flaws fixable"

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-green-900 rounded">
This mindset is <strong>braver</strong>. Shipping requires vulnerability.
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
Iteration requires courage.
Showing imperfect work is vulnerable.
-->

---

# Practical Tactics

<v-clicks>

**Set a ship date and honor it.**
"By Friday, something goes live." Whatever state.

**Define "good enough."**
Before building: "V1 is good enough if it can ___."

**Show work early.**
The longer you hide, the more precious it becomes.

**Celebrate shipping, not perfection.**
"We shipped!" is the win.

**Remember: you can iterate.**
V1.0 becomes V1.1. Ship now, improve tomorrow.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Concrete tactics to overcome perfectionism.
External constraints help.

# Key Insights

| Concept | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| MVP first | Build the smallest useful thing |
| Feedback beats imagination | Real users reveal what matters |
| Ship early, improve later | Existence beats perfection |
| Iteration reduces risk | Small bets, quick corrections |
| Perfectionism is fear | Shipping requires courage |

<!--
These are the takeaways.
Iteration is both strategy and mindset.
-->

---

# Reflection Questions

<v-clicks>

1. Why might an "embarrassing" first version lead to a better final product?

2. You have limited time. Three features at 60% quality or one at 100%?

3. How does iteration change the relationship between planning and doing?

</v-clicks>

<!--
Q1: Real feedback improves direction
Q2: Depends, but often breadth reveals what's valuable
Q3: Planning is continuous, not upfront
